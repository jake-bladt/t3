### T3 Tic-Tac-Toe Simulator
This is a tic-tac-toe game written using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript for a programming exercise. It is entirely self-contained and should run in any compatible modern brower. It was tested with Chrome on Ubuntu and is guaranteed not to work on IE 6 or 7 because it makes use of JavaScript's indexOf method.

It's still a little rough around the edges, but the gameplay is correct and I'm pretty sure the AI is unbeatable. To run it, clone this repo and open index.html in your browser.

Anyone who wants to use this code to advance the state-of-the-art in tic-tac-toe is welcome to do so.
